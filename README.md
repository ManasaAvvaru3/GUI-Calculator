An electronic calculator, commonly portable but not necessarily, is a device used to compute mathematical, scientific, and engineering issues. 
They are widely used in both professional and educational settings, entirely replacing slide rules in traditional applications. 
Tkinter was used in the implementation of the Python calculator to facilitate the computation of mathematical functions.
Standard and scientific functions are included in the application. Math functions like sin, cos, tan, log, and others that need  notation are solved using this standard.  
The suggested system has no errors. Simple Python language ideas are incorporated into the system.
Because the Python Tkinter GUI included a variety of controls, including buttons, labels, and text boxes, it was possible to create an application that was easy for users to navigate. 
The internet's exponential growth and usage validates the project's enormous potential
